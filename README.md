To access the application we must enter our LDAP server username and password configured in (ldap-data.ldif file)

Once we have entered the application, it will take us to the main screen, where we must enter the words we want to play with, this screen allows us to start the game by clicking on the Play button.

When you click on the play button, the application shows the game window, where we can see the alphabet soup and on the right a column with the words to find

![Play](https://github.com/hectoresquerdo/BACK-EE-NDS/blob/master/images/play.png)

When we find a word, we position ourselves with the mouse on the first letter of the word and by pressing the right mouse button we will drag until all the letters that compose it are selected, while the selection is made, the letters are shown in orange

At the end of the selection, if done correctly, the word will turn blue and will be crossed out from the right column

If you find all of them, the board appears with a green background and the words found highlighted in white
